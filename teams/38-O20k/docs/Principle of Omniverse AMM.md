## Principle
The basic philosophy of an AMM (automated market maker) is very simple, it obeys a simple rule that the price of token $X$ is as $P_{X|Y}(x,y)=\frac{dy}{dx}$, where $x$ and $y$ is the amount of the reserves of token $X$ and token $Y$. In most situations the expression of $P_{X|Y}(x,y)$ satisfies that the price of token $X$ and its reserve amount $x$ are negatively correlated.  
### Background
The `Uniswap` and `Curve` have done two typical cases. `Uniswap`<sup>[1]</sup> provides the succinct $xy=k$ as its basic AMM mechanism and works well for tokens on Ethereum, and projects like `Bancor`, `Kyber` have made improvements from `Uniswap`. Simply speaking, they are working for price-unstable tokens.  
`Curve`<sup>[2]</sup> walks another way, and they have done a great job for the exchanging of price-stable coins. The ideal strategy for stablecoin trading is that one token $X$ always exchange a fixed amount of token $Y$. But in Web3 world the "stable" coin does not always stable at all, so when the pool slopes too much, there needs to be suitable mechanism to solve it. In general, `Curve` provides an ingenious curve that closes to $x+y=\text{const}$ but very steep on the edges of both sides.  

### O-AMM solution
Our solution is different from the above. I will explain our solution just in the case of tokens pair, as it's not very hard to extend to multi-tokens.   
Firstly, we want to make a trading pair's "smoothly trading range" wider than Uniswap. As we know, the marketing curve $xy=k$ is very easy to go into the steep area.  
Secondly, we want the marketing curve can be dynamically adapt to different situations, that is, when $x\approx y$ the marketing curve is closing to `Curve` and when $x$ differs from $y$ much we hope the curve is closing to `Uniswap`.  
The following *equation 1* is the core mechanism of `O-AMM` algorithm:  
$$\alpha(-(x^2+y^2)+bx+by)+(1-\alpha)C=2xy$$  
<p align="center">Equation.1 the equation of O-AMM</p>  
where,  

$$\alpha =\frac{xy}{(\frac{x+y}{2})^2}$$  

The expression of $\alpha$ is the quotient of the geometric mean over arithmetic mean, which is a way to quantify the degree of the difference between $x$ and $y$.  
$b$ and $C$ is determined by the liquidity size of the initial pool, and every time the liquidity changes (put in or fetch out), they will be re-calculated.  

$$\left \{ \begin {array}{lcl}
C = x_{init}\cdot y_{init}\\
b = 2\sqrt{C}
\end{array}\right.$$  

The following *Figure 1* shows the difference between `O-AMM` and other AMM mechanisms:

<p align="center">Figure.1 the curves of different AMM mechanisms</p>  

The curve of `O-AMM` is symmetric about $x = y$ like other AMM curves, which is a basic feature of AMM because token $X$ and token $Y$ should be treated as the same.  
The curve of `O-AMM` lies between `Uniswap` and `Curve`, so in general it is able to combine price sensitivity and smoother trading.  

### Gas Mechanism
Solving *equation 1* on-chain is expensive, and we will provide a verifiable computation<sup>[3]</sup> mechanism to make it.  
Genaral VC (verifiable computaion) is complex, but in our situation we provide a simple way to solve this customization issue.  
We just record the expression of *Equation 1* on-chain, calculate $b$ and $C$ every time the liquidity changes. When someone makes swap bwteen token $X$ and token $Y$, he makes `Omniverse Transfer` of one kind of token (take token $X$ for instance) to the contract-account of the Omniverse Swap, who records the value of $\Delta{x}$. Some off-chain VC nodes are listenning the event of the swaps, they calculate $\Delta{y}$ and submit it to the on-chain `Omniverse Swap`. The verification of $\Delta{x}$ and $\Delta{y}$ within *Equation 1* is very easy and cheap, and the off-chain VC node whose submission is accepted will be rewarded.  

### How O-AMM Comes Out
The way to make out *Equation 1* is somewhat mathematical skilled, but I don't want to explain the details at this stage because we decided to participate in this hackathon so late that there might not be enough time for us. I will give a detailed idea in the future. In short, it is a combination of two equations that are inverse functions of each other.  

## Implementation
In this hackathon, we have designed and made the simulation of our Omniverse AMM algorithm, but until now the on-chain version of O9P is the simplest, that is, we temperarily uses $x\cdot y=k$ as the AMM mechanism to **prove the Omniverse Protocols**.

## Key points
### Price
Suppose there are token X and token Y, and the price of X means how many Ys of a token X deserves. Suppose the reserve of X is x, and the reserve of Y is y.  

$$P_{X|Y}(x,y)=\frac{y}{x}$$

### Liquidity Deposit
Keep the price not change.  
$$\frac{y+\Delta{y}}{x+\Delta{x}}=\frac{y}{x}$$  

The key point of the implementation of the interface `add pool` is that given $x$, $y$ and $\Delta x$, the rest $\Delta y$ can be determined.  

#### Working Flow
* The provider calls `get expected pool` to get $\Delta y$ if input $\Delta x$, and vice versa.
* The provider encapsulates Omniverse Transfer of **both** $X$ and $Y$ from provider's account to swap account(contract MPC wallet account).
* The on-chain swap makes the on-chain checking for the validation of amount $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ according to the fomula above.
* The on-chain Omniverse Swap updates and records the new state of the pool.
* The on-chain swap sends the two encapsulated Omniverse Transactions to the related on-chain Omniverse token.
* The Omniverse tokens of $X$ and $Y$ processes the transfers.

#### Note
We can also provide a liquidity value $\ell$ to calculate $\Delta{x}$ and $\Delta{y}$:  
$$\left \{ \begin {array}{lcl}
\frac{y+\Delta{y}}{x+\Delta{x}}=\frac{y}{x}\\
(x+\Delta{x})(y+\Delta{y})=xy+\ell
\end{array}\right.$$  
Solving this system of equations yields:  
$$\left \{ \begin {array}{lcl}
\Delta{x}=\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}(xy+\ell)}-x\\
\Delta{y}=\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}(xy+\ell)}-y
\end{array}\right.$$

###  Liquidity Withdraw
Given the withdraw amount of the liquidity $\ell$, solve the following system of equations to get $\Delta{x}$ and $\Delta{y}$:  
$$\left \{ \begin {array}{lcl}
\frac{y-\Delta{y}}{x-\Delta{x}}=\frac{y}{x}\\
(x-\Delta{x})(y-\Delta{y})=xy-\ell
\end{array}\right.$$  

The result is:  

$$\left \{ \begin {array}{lcl}
\Delta{x}=x-\sqrt{\frac{x}{y}(xy-\ell)}\\
\Delta{y}=y-\sqrt{\frac{y}{x}(xy-\ell)}
\end{array}\right.$$  


### Swap
Keep the liquidity $xy=k$ not change.  
Input $\Delta x$, solve the output of $\Delta y$.  
$$(x+\Delta x)(y-\Delta y)=xy$$  

For instance, given $x$, $y$ and $\Delta x$, the rest $\Delta y$ can be solved as:  
$$\Delta y = y-\frac{xy}{x+\Delta x}=\frac{y\Delta x}{x+\Delta x}$$  

#### Working Flow
* A normal user claims his tokens of $X$ or $Y$ from related on-chain Omniverse tokens.
* A normal user encapsulates an Omniverse trasfer of token $X$ or $Y$ and calls `make swap` on Omniverse Swap.
* The Omniverse Swap calculates the output amount of the opponent token, and generate an on-chain transfer in its pre-transfer cache.
* The off-chain Contract Wallet Account(MPC) makes a signature to the swap transferring out on the Omniverse Swap cache.
* The Omniverse Swap call on-chain Omniverse token to make the transfer.
 
### Half V3
* The initial propotion of $x$ and $y$ is $1:2$, that is, 10,000 $X$ and 20,000 $Y$. So the initial price is $P_{X|Y}=2$. 
* We limit the range of $x:y$ as $[1000:1, 1:1000]$. As a result, the range price of $X$ is $[0.001, 1000]$. If the price exceeds the range, the pool is resetted as $(x=10,000, y=20,000)$.
